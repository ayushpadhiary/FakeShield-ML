## 📖 Overview

FakeShield is a Machine Learning-based Fake News Detection system that classifies news articles as **Real** or **Fake** using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The project performs data preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization, trains multiple machine learning models, evaluates their performance, and predicts whether a news article is genuine or fake.
